# My Library

A website where a user can keep track of books they have read and would like to read. Built using React with a Firebase backend.

## Functionality
  - Books can be added using the 'Add New Book' button, a popup appers where a title, author, page number, and read status can be entered.
  - The books are then pushed to a Firebase Firestore database.
  - The user can update if they have read the book by clicking the 'Change Read Status' button.
  - Books can be removed using the 'Remove Book' Button.

## Notes
  - I initially built this as a vanilla JS app, but returned to the project to rewrite it using React. I then added Firebase Firestore as a backend.
  - This project is hosted using Firebase.
  - This was built as part of the Odin Project curriculum. [Project description](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-library)
